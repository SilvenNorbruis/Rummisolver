# Rummisolver

A real life cheatscript for Rummikup...

The goal of this project is to make a algorithm that finds the best possible legal Rummikup plays. 
First find a legal opening play, then find the best legal play with the heighest amount of tiles used.

For the best userexperience the plan is to use computervision to take a picture of the players board, and the tiles in the wild to use as input for the Rummikup algorithm.

The program is still in an early stage, so dont expect it to work.



TODO: 

Add Input for new tiles, is in the wild (on the table) and on the players board.
Implement Jokers
